The print and paper industry operates on tight deadlines and thin margins. In this fast-paced environment, every minute of uptime counts. Your RollMover is a workhorse, but the unique challenges of a paper mill or pressroom—from heavy, delicate rolls to pervasive paper dust—put extraordinary demands on your equipment.

General maintenance advice is a good start, but understanding the specific failure points in your industry is the key to truly proactive care. At Artic Power Solutions, we've seen firsthand how these challenges affect equipment. Here’s our targeted advice for keeping your RollMovers performing flawlessly and reducing costly downtime.

### The Hidden Enemy: Paper Dust

It’s everywhere, and it’s more than just a housekeeping issue. Fine paper dust can wreak havoc on your RollMover’s internal components.

* **Overheating Motors:** Dust acts like an insulating blanket, preventing the motor from dissipating heat effectively. An overheating motor loses efficiency and is at high risk of premature failure.
* **Electrical Issues:** Dust can coat electrical contacts and circuit boards, leading to intermittent connection problems or even short circuits.

**Industry-Specific Tip:** Implement a schedule for blowing out the motor housing and electrical compartments with compressed air. A quick, regular cleaning is one of the most effective preventative measures you can take.

### High-Stress Wear on Drive Components

The constant, precise movements required to load a press or maneuver a multi-ton paper roll puts immense stress on the drivetrain.

* **Drive Wheel Wear:** The constant start-and-stop motion accelerates wear on the drive wheel. A worn wheel loses traction, causing slippage that can damage rolls and create safety hazards. In paper mills, small debris can become embedded in the wheel, further reducing performance.
* **Battery Strain:** High-demand, continuous use drains batteries faster and leads to more charge cycles, shortening the battery's overall lifespan.

**Industry-Specific Tip:** Regularly inspect the drive wheel's surface for embedded debris and glazing. Also, closely monitor battery performance. If you notice a significant drop in how long a charge lasts, it might be a sign that the battery is nearing the end of its life.

### Choosing Parts That Withstand the Pressure

Given these challenges, using standard, off-the-shelf replacement parts may not be enough. To truly maximize uptime, you need components designed for the job. Making the right choice between [OEM vs. Compatible RollMover Parts](/blog/oem-vs-compatible) is a key first step in this process.

* **High-Durometer Polyurethane Wheels:** Invest in a [drive wheel made from a harder polyurethane](/parts/durable-polyurethane-drive-wheel-APS-WHL-01). This type of material is more durable and less likely to pick up and embed debris, ensuring better traction for longer.
* **Heavy-Duty, High-Cycle Batteries:** When it's time to replace your battery, choose one that is [specifically designed for high-demand, high-cycle applications](/parts/high-performance-lithium-battery-APS-BAT-01). These batteries provide more consistent power and a longer service life in a 24/7 operational environment.

### A Partner Who Understands Your Industry
