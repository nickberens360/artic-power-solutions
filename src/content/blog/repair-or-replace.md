When a critical piece of equipment like your RollMover starts to show its age or breaks down, it can bring your operations to a halt. This leaves you with a major decision: should you invest in a repair, or is it time to replace the unit entirely?

This isn't just a technical questionâ€”it's a significant financial one. At Artic Power Solutions, we believe in providing long-term value to our customers. To help you make a smart investment, we've put together this cost-benefit analysis to guide you through the decision-making process.

## The Upfront Cost of Replacement

The most obvious factor is the cost of a new RollMover. A new machine is a significant capital expenditure. While it comes with the latest features and a full warranty, the high upfront cost can be a major hurdle for many businesses.

Beyond the sticker price, you should also consider the "hidden costs" of replacement:

**Training:** Your team will need to be trained on the new model.

**Integration:** You may need to update your internal records and maintenance schedules.

**Disposal:** There may be costs associated with disposing of your old unit.

## The Long-Term Value of Repair

In many cases, repairing your existing RollMover is the most cost-effective solution. Here's why:

**Significant Cost Savings:** The cost of common repairs, such as replacing a [battery](/parts/high-performance-lithium-battery-APS-BAT-01), a [wheel](/parts/durable-polyurethane-drive-wheel-APS-WHL-01), or even a [motor controller](/parts/programmable-speed-controller-APS-CTL-01), is often just a fraction of the price of a new machine. When considering the price of parts, it's also worth weighing the benefits of [OEM vs. Compatible RollMover Parts](/blog/oem-vs-compatible).

**Extend the Lifespan of Your Asset:** A well-built RollMover can last for many years with proper maintenance and high-quality repairs. By replacing worn components, you can significantly extend the life of your initial investment.

**No Hidden Costs:** With a repair, your team can get back to work with the equipment they already know and trust. There are no new procedures to learn or integrate into your workflow.

## A Checklist to Help You Decide

Ask yourself these questions to determine the best course of action for your business:

**What is the age and overall condition of the RollMover?**

If the unit is relatively new and has been well-maintained, a repair is almost always the best option.

If the unit is very old and the frame or other major components are in poor condition, replacement might be a more logical choice.

**What is the estimated cost of the repair?**

Get a quote for the repair. If the cost is less than 50% of the price of a new unit, a repair is likely the more financially sound decision.

**How frequently has the unit been breaking down?**

If this is the first major issue after years of reliable service, a repair makes sense.

If the unit is breaking down constantly, the cumulative cost and downtime might justify a replacement.

**Does the current model still meet your needs?**

If your operational needs have changed and your current RollMover is no longer adequate, a new model with different features might be necessary.
