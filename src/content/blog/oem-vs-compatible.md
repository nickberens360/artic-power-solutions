When it’s time to repair your RollMover, you face a critical decision: should you use parts from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), or should you opt for high-quality compatible parts?

It’s a common misconception that OEM is always the superior choice. While OEM parts are guaranteed to be an exact match, they often come with a premium price tag and longer lead times. At Artic Power Solutions, we specialize in providing top-tier compatible parts that offer an unbeatable combination of quality, availability, and value.

To help you make an informed decision, let's break down the key factors.

### Defining the Terms: OEM vs. Compatible

* **OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer):** These are parts made by the same company that originally manufactured your RollMover. They are identical to the parts that were in your machine when it was new.
* **Compatible (or Aftermarket):** These are parts made by a third-party company. High-quality compatible parts are designed to meet or even exceed the specifications of the OEM parts, providing the same level of performance and reliability.

### Comparing the Key Factors

Let's compare these two options based on what matters most to your business.

#### **1. Cost**

This is the most significant difference. OEM parts are almost always more expensive. The manufacturers set a high price because they are the sole source. High-quality compatible parts, on the other hand, can offer substantial cost savings without sacrificing performance, allowing you to reduce your maintenance budget.

**Winner: Compatible Parts**

#### **2. Quality and Performance**

This is where the myth of "OEM is always better" needs to be addressed. While there are certainly low-quality aftermarket parts on the market, a reputable supplier of compatible parts is committed to excellence.

At Artic Power Solutions, we source and manufacture our parts to meet or exceed OEM standards. We use durable materials and rigorous testing to ensure that every component we sell, from a [battery](/parts/high-performance-lithium-battery-APS-BAT-01) to a [drive wheel](/parts/durable-polyurethane-drive-wheel-APS-WHL-01), will perform reliably under the demanding conditions of your workplace.

**Winner: It's a Tie** (with a reputable supplier)

#### **3. Availability**

Downtime costs money. When a machine is down, you need the replacement part as quickly as possible. OEM parts can sometimes have long lead times, especially for older models, forcing you to wait days or even weeks.

A dedicated parts supplier like Artic Power Solutions often has a large inventory of common compatible parts in stock and ready to ship immediately, getting your RollMover back in action much faster.

**Winner: Compatible Parts**

### The Smart Choice for Your Business

For most businesses, choosing high-quality compatible parts is the smartest financial and operational decision. You get a reliable, top-performing component at a fraction of the cost and with better availability. This allows you to maintain your equipment, minimize downtime, and protect your bottom line.

Don't let the OEM label lock you into higher costs and longer waits. The team at Artic Power Solutions is here to provide you with a better alternative.
