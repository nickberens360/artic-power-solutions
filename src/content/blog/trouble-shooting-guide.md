That's why we've created this ultimate maintenance checklist to help you keep your RollMover in peak condition.

## The Ultimate RollMover Maintenance Checklist

A little preventive maintenance goes a long way. By following this schedule, you can catch small issues before they become big problems.

### Daily Checks (Before Each Use)

Perform these quick checks at the start of every shift to ensure the RollMover is safe and ready to operate.

- **Inspect for visible damage:** Look for any cracks, dents, or other signs of wear and tear on the frame, handle, and rollers.
- **Check the battery level:** Ensure the battery has enough charge for the upcoming tasks.
- **Test the controls:** Verify that the forward and reverse controls are functioning correctly.
- **Check the horn and safety features:** Make sure the horn is audible and all safety mechanisms are in working order.
- **Wipe down the machine:** A quick wipe-down can prevent dirt and debris from building up in critical components.

### Weekly Checks

Once a week, take a few extra minutes to perform a more thorough inspection.

- **Clean the wheels and rollers:** Remove any debris, such as plastic wrap or strapping, that may have become entangled in the wheels.
- **Inspect the battery connections:** Check for any corrosion on the battery terminals and ensure the connections are tight.
- **Check tire pressure (if applicable):** If your RollMover has pneumatic tires, make sure they are inflated to the recommended pressure.
- **Lubricate moving parts:** Apply lubricant to any specified pivot points or moving parts as recommended in your owner's manual.

### Monthly Checks

These more in-depth checks will help you identify any developing issues.

- **Inspect all wiring:** Look for any frayed or damaged wires and ensure all connections are secure.
- **Check the charger:** Make sure the battery charger is working correctly and the charging cables are in good condition.
- **Test the braking system:** Ensure the braking system engages smoothly and holds the RollMover securely.
- **Inspect the drive train:** Check for any signs of wear on the gears, chains, or belts.

### Annual Professional Service

While regular in-house maintenance is crucial, we recommend having your RollMover professionally serviced at least once a year. A trained technician can perform a comprehensive inspection, diagnose any potential issues, and make any necessary adjustments or repairs.
