Is your RollMover acting up? Don't let unexpected downtime disrupt your operations! At Artic Power Solutions, we know how vital your RollMover is for keeping your materials and workflow moving smoothly. That's why we've put together this guide to help you identify and troubleshoot 5 of the most common issues you might encounter.

***Disclaimer:*** *While these steps can help with minor problems, always prioritize safety. If you are ever uncomfortable performing these checks or if the issue persists, please contact our expert team for professional repair services.*

### 1. Battery Won't Charge or Dies Quickly

A dead or underperforming battery is one of the most frequent and frustrating issues.

**Symptoms:**
- The battery fails to take a charge.
- The battery indicator shows a full charge, but it drains much faster than usual.

**Possible Causes & Troubleshooting:**

-   **Check the Connections:** Ensure the charger is firmly plugged into both the wall outlet and the RollMover. Check the battery terminals for any corrosion or looseness. A good, clean connection is essential for proper charging.
-   **Inspect the Charger:** Look for any signs of damage to the charging cable or the charger itself. If the charger has indicator lights, see if they signal a fault.
-   **Evaluate Battery Age:** Like all rechargeable batteries, your RollMover's battery has a finite lifespan. If it's several years old and its performance has been steadily declining, it may be time for a replacement.

### 2. RollMover Won't Move

You press the controls, but nothing happens. This is another common problem that can often be fixed quickly.

**Symptoms:**
- The unit is powered on, but it does not move in forward or reverse.

**Possible Causes & Troubleshooting:**

-   **Check the Battery Level:** The most common culprit is simply a dead battery. Ensure it has a sufficient charge.
-   **Verify Safety Switches:** Many RollMovers have safety features, like an emergency stop button or a "belly button" switch on the handle. Make sure none of these have been accidentally triggered.
-   **Inspect the Wheels:** Check for any obstructions around the wheels, such as debris, shrink wrap, or pallet fragments.

### 3. Unusual Noises During Operation

Grinding, squeaking, or clicking noises are signs that your RollMover needs attention.

**Symptoms:**
- You hear new or unusual sounds coming from the wheels, motor, or frame.

**Possible Causes & Troubleshooting:**

-   **Look for Loose Hardware:** Inspect the unit for any loose bolts, nuts, or panels.
-   **Check the Wheels:** Worn-out wheel bearings are a common source of noise. Also, check for debris caught in the wheel assemblies.
-   **Lubrication:** Refer to your owner's manual for recommended lubrication points and schedules.

### 4. Difficulty Steering or Maneuvering

If the RollMover is difficult to control, it can be both inefficient and unsafe.

**Symptoms:**
- The unit feels stiff, is hard to turn, or doesn't steer smoothly.

**Possible Causes & Troubleshooting:**

-   **Check Tire Pressure (if applicable):** If your model has pneumatic tires, ensure they are inflated to the correct pressure.
-   **Inspect Steering Linkages:** Look for any bent or damaged components in the steering mechanism.
-   **Lubricate Pivot Points:** The steering mechanism has several pivot points that may require lubrication.

### 5. The Motor is Overheating

An overheating motor is a serious issue that should be addressed immediately to prevent permanent damage.

**Symptoms:**
- The motor housing is excessively hot to the touch.
- You notice a burning smell coming from the unit.

**Possible Causes & Troubleshooting:**

-   **Check for Overloading:** Ensure you are not exceeding the RollMover's maximum load capacity.
-   **Inspect for Blockages:** Make sure there is nothing restricting the movement of the wheels, causing the motor to work harder than it should.
-   **Clean the Motor Housing:** Dust and debris can build up on the motor, trapping heat. Carefully clean any accumulation off the motor housing.
