The drive wheel is where the rubber meets the road. Our compatible high-durometer polyurethane drive wheel is engineered to provide maximum grip and durability, reducing slippage and ensuring efficient movement of heavy rolls. This wheel is resistant to picking up floor debris, which helps maintain traction and extends its service life.

- **Superior Traction:** The specially formulated polyurethane provides excellent grip on a variety of floor surfaces.
- **High Durability:** Resistant to wear, tear, and chunking, even under high-stress use.
- **Perfect Compatibility:** Designed to be a perfect fit for the Appleton RollMoverâ„¢ series, ensuring smooth and safe operation.

If you're experiencing a loss of traction or see visible wear on your current wheel, it's time for a replacement.
