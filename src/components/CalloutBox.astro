        <p>Manufacturer warranties often have exclusions for "improper use," "unauthorized modifications," or
          "normal wear and tear," leading to denied claims. <strong>If your repair isn't covered, you are not
            out of options.</strong> We provide the fast, cost-effective repair solutions you need to get your
          equipment running, regardless of its warranty status.</p>
